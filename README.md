# Breast-Cancer-classification
Machine learning project using an open-source database for breast cancer classification.

data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

In this project, I demonstrate the following:
- data cleaning (dropping missing values)
- feature engineering (encoding categorical variables)
- model building (logistic regression and random forest classifier)
- model evaluation (via precision and recall)
